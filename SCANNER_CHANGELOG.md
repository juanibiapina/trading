# Scanner & Process Changelog

This file tracks all automated changes made to the scanning system. It is read and updated by the daily improvement cycle.

## How to Read This Log

Each entry documents:
- **Context**: What happened in recent scans that prompted the change
- **Changes**: Exactly what was modified, in which files, and why
- **Hypothesis**: What we expect to improve
- **Evaluation**: Assessment of whether previous changes helped (added in subsequent entries)

## Current Scanner Parameters

```
MIN_PRICE = 0.5
MAX_PRICE = 10.0
MAX_MARKET_CAP = 100,000,000 ($100M)
MIN_AH_VOLUME = 50,000
MIN_AH_CHANGE = 5%
MIN_PM_VOLUME = 50,000
MIN_PM_CHANGE = 5%
MIN_INTRADAY_RVOL = 10
MIN_5M_VOLUME = 5,000
```

## Current Process

- 7 evening scans every 30 min (21:30–01:30 CET)
- 2 morning evaluations (10:05, 10:20 CET)
- Paper trades with ~€100 positions
- Biotech/pharma preferred (non-biotech historically 0% win rate)
- Entry rules: <50% above close, float <10M, catalyst required, first day of unusual volume

## Modifiable Files

- `scripts/scan.py` — Scanner parameters, filters, output columns
- `scripts/check-prices.py` — Price checking utility
- `prompts/post-market-scan.md` — Evening scan prompt (evaluation criteria, log format)
- `prompts/morning-evaluation.md` — Morning evaluation prompt

### 2026-03-10 — Initial Setup

**Context:** System deployed. First night of 30-min scanning ran successfully. 19 tickers found across 7 scans. One paper trade (ACXP) entered at AH peak, lost -29.5%.

**Known Issues:**
1. Scanner only shows change from same-day close — misses multi-day moves (ACXP was +113% from Friday, appeared as +47%)
2. No bearish divergence detection (volume up + price down = distribution)
3. Tier B catalysts (FDA-adjacent) are 0/2 — may need downgrade
4. All AH movers faded overnight on 2026-03-09 — need more data to assess if this is typical

**Baseline Metrics:**
- Scanner catch rate: 86% (6/7 PM movers found in evening scans)
- Paper trade P&L: -€27 (1 trade)
- False positive rate: high (19 tickers found, only 1 remotely actionable)
